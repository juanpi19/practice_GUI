# practice_GUI
This is an expense tracker application that I created using Tkinter and Sqlite3. I have also used Pandas and Matplotlib to include charts that help the user understand how the money has been spent

I worked on this project for about ten days and I tied a lot of different technologies together. 
You find three different windows on this app.

1. Expense: here you create, read, update and delete records. 
2. Analaysis: Using matplotlib and pandas I added some charts and analysis that help the user understand how the money has been spent
3. Budget: With Pandas I provide the user with useful information like how much it's been spent each month and I also help the user set an specific amount for each month

The design was made using the python library Tkinter.

YOU CAN FIND THE PICTURES OF HOW THE APP LOOKS LIKE ON THE EXPENSETRACKER_PICTURES FOLDER
